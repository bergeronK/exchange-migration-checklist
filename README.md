# Exchange Migration Checklist

Recently, I have been working on Exchange migration projects and the “[70-345 – Designing and Deploying Microsoft Exchange Server 2016” exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-345.aspx). I have found [resources on PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/migrating-exchange-server-2016) to be of great help, such as [this one](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/migrating-exchange-server-2016). Based on studies, a checklist including PowerShell commands has been crafted in the hopes of easily keeping track of milestones throughout similar projects. The example is for non-HA migration scenario from Exchange 2010 and 2013 to 2016.
